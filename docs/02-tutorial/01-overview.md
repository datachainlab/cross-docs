# Overview

This tutorial explains how to develop a `Cross-chain` application enabling atomic swap between [Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/fabric) and [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/) based blockchain through a demo application using `Cross Framework`, [fabric-tendermint-cross-demo](https://github.com/datachainlab/fabric-tendermint-cross-demo).  
But not all of them need to be developed from scratch.  
This tutorial focuses on how [Contract Module](../01-docs/03-architecture/01-overview.md#contract-module) is developed, how it is applied to the Application, and how each of the functionalities is executed by CLI.

This demo works by [Simple commit protocol](../01-docs/03-architecture/04-atomic-commit-protocol.md#simple-commit-protocol) as [Atomic commit protocol](../01-docs/03-architecture/04-atomic-commit-protocol.md#atomic-commit-protocol).
