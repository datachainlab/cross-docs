# Create Blockchain Applications

This part explains how to develop Blockchain Application with Cross Framework.
In [fabric-tendermint-cross-demo](https://github.com/datachainlab/fabric-tendermint-cross-demo), `Tendermint based blockchain` and `Hyperledger Fabric` are used for Cross-chain.

Each of application explanations in demo are as the below.

- [Fabric](https://github.com/datachainlab/fabric-tendermint-cross-demo/tree/main/demo/chains/fabric)
  - [Fabibc Application](https://github.com/datachainlab/fabric-tendermint-cross-demo/tree/main/demo/chains/fabric/chaincode/fabibc)
- [Tendermint Application](https://github.com/datachainlab/fabric-tendermint-cross-demo/tree/main/demo/chains/tendermint)

## Features

These applications are implemented using [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk). First of all, understanding of [BaseApp](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/core/baseapp.html) is required.

As explanation between [Fabric Application](https://github.com/datachainlab/fabric-tendermint-cross-demo/tree/main/demo/chains/fabric/chaincode/fabibc) and [Tendermint Application](https://github.com/datachainlab/fabric-tendermint-cross-demo/tree/main/demo/chains/tendermint), regardless of the blockchain difference, the way how to modify is exactly the same.
